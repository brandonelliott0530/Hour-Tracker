# Hour-Tracker

## Purpose

---

This is an application that will help flat-rate technicians track the hours that they have produced. For too long, technicians have had to keep track of their hours the old fashioned way. With a pen and a piece of paper. My aim with this application is to provide an easier, and more accurate way for those technicians to track their hours. This app will do far more than simply add up hours. Let's take a look.

## Features

---

- Ability to automatically add up the hours that the user passes in to the application, and calculate their efficiency based on their work schedule.
- Calculate the user's efficiency for the pay period.
- Calculate the user's monthly efficiency.
- Calculate the user's yearly efficiency.
- Calculate the user's efficiency vs the previous pay period, month, and year.
- Calculate the average hours per repair order.
- The user will be able to input the repair order number, the lines that contain billable work, and give a discription of what they did for that line.
- Label the lines of the repair order as either customer pay or warranty work.
- Calculate the ratio of their customer pay to warranty work.
- Track the number of repair orders that the user has worked on for that pay period, as well as have a running total for that month, as well as a grand total for the year.
- Be able to track how many hours behind or ahead they are of 100% efficiency for that pay period.
- Have the ability to flag repair orders if they believe something is missing from their booked time, so they will rememeber to resolve that with either a service advisor or the warranty booker
